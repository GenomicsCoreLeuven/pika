Pikasub2 is a changed version of pikasub.sh.

Make an alias of pikasub2.sh, this makes submitting jobs easy
--- Source pikasub2.sh ---
--- check_config_file ---
This can all be written in the bashrc for easier use.

The pikasub2 needs to be sourced, then you all the commands that come with pika will be available in the hpc.
Basedir is adjusted and is now fully functional in the source map after sourcing it. 
When a single job or batch job is submitted by pika, the program will make a map with the date and time of submission. 
Everything will then be written in that directory.

The scripts are still usefull to pikasub2.
If the script exists in the directory of scripts, then pika will be very easy to use.
Make a copy of the script that needs to be used.
--- script_to_engine "the copy of the script" ---
The command "script to engine" will fill in the scripts ##[RUN] parameters into the specified engine that was given in 
the config file.
(if the engine exists in pika)
--- copy_and_correct_script "the script" ---
This function will fill in all the modules that need to be loaded from the module file and all the directories already
specified in the config file (ex. genome_directory).

-------------------------------------------------- pipeline generation ------------------------------------------------
If a pipeline needs to be generated pika can give you an flowchart but NOT a working pipeline which submits all the tasks
for you.

The pipeline generation is easy. Open your favorite text-editor and write the pipeline with ##[JOB] before the script that
has to be used.

Fill in the mandatory options or change them with commands like 'sed' or 'awk' before submitting this as a pipeline.

--- copy_pipeline "the crafted pipeline file" ---

This command will check for the jobs in the directory off the scripts and copy the ##[HOWTO] of the scripts into the pipeline.
It will also check how many ##[JOB] there are and echo them back. 
The result is a howto file of the pipeline and how to submit each job into the hpc.

--- For further investigation the libs files can be opened to find other commands from pika ---
