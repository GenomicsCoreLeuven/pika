#sga pipeline

##[HELP] The SGA pipeline for denovo assembly of illumina data
##[HELP] =====================================================
##[HELP] 
##[HELP] The pipeline starts from one or multiple runs (samples)
##[HELP] After the preprocessing, preqc of the runs/libraries/samples are done. Here you can find premillary stats of the genome.

##[HOWTO] #This script describes how to execute the sga pipeline.
##[HOWTO] #After the copy, a file will be generated with this info, together with the standard help.
##[HOWTO] #Further more the generated file will contain all commands needed to launch the scripts on the HPC.
##[HOWTO] #Together with short one line commands to generate needed files, and check temperary results.

#needed modules:

#Creation of the samples file: (for the multithreading, where 20 is the number of threads, change to 1 for single threading)
echo "SAMPLE,THREADS" > samples.txt;
cat ../raw/*/barcodes.tsv | awk '{print $1",20"}' | sort | uniq >> samples.txt;

#You need to check the results of the preqc. This also includes the optimal kmer selection for the correction (you will have to change this in the sga_correct.pbs
