#sga pipeline

##[HELP] The SGA pipeline for denovo assembly of illumina data
##[HELP] =====================================================
##[HELP] 
##[HELP] The pipeline starts from one or multiple runs (samples)
##[HELP] After the preprocessing, preqc of the runs/libraries/samples are done. Here you can find premillary stats of the genome.

##[HOWTO] #This script describes how to execute the sga pipeline.
##[HOWTO] #After the copy, a file will be generated with this info, together with the standard help.
##[HOWTO] #Further more the generated file will contain all commands needed to launch the scripts on the HPC.
##[HOWTO] #Together with short one line commands to generate needed files, and check temperary results.

#needed modules:

#all samples must be in the fastq dir of the project, named R1 and R2 (for read 1 and read 2), and must be gziped
#Creation of the samples file: (for the multithreading, where 20 is the number of threads, change to 1 for single threading)
echo "SAMPLE,THREADS" > samples.txt;
ls -1 -d ../../raw/*R1* | sed 's:../../::g' | sed 's:.R1.fastq.gz::g' | awk '{print $1",20"}' | sort | uniq >> samples.txt;
