#PacBio Variant Calling pipeline

##[HELP] The PacBio Variant Calling pipeline
##[HELP] ===================================
##[HELP] 
##[HELP] The pipeline starts from one or multiple samples (in the raw directory)
##[HELP] Samples should be subreads for low passes (passes<3), or CCS reads (passes>3)
##[HELP] 
##[HELP] For each sample, the overlapping reads are merged to fragments (flash)
##[HELP] BWA is used for mapping the samples to the reference genome
##[HELP] A mpileup file is created from these mapped data
##[HELP] Variants are called with VarScan

##[HOWTO] #This script describes how to execute the PacBio Variant Calling pipeline.
##[HOWTO] #After the copy, a file will be generated with this info, together with the standard help.
##[HOWTO] #Further more the generated file will contain all commands needed to launch the scripts on the HPC.
##[HOWTO] #Together with short one line commands to generate needed files, and check temperary results.

#needed modules:

#Samples should be in the raw directory under the project
#Samples should be gziped and named: samplename.R1.fastq.gz
#gzip samples:
gzip *fastq;
#rename: (this will rename all gziped samples without R1.fastq.gz extention to one with this extention)
for i in `ls -1 -d *.fastq.gz | grep -v '.R1.fastq.gz'`; do j=`echo $i | sed 's:.fastq:.R1.fastq:g'`; mv $i $j; done

#create the samples.txt file:
echo "SAMPLE" > samples.txt;
ls -1 -d ../raw/*.R1.fastq.gz | sed 's:../raw/::g' | sed 's:.R1.fastq.gz::g' >> samples.txt;
